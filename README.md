# **Business Context**

Superstore is experiencing financial difficulties and requires an in-depth analysis to identify profitability drivers, inefficiencies, and opportunities for optimization. This analysis will guide decisions on product strategy, advertising investments, and return management to prevent further losses and enhance overall performance.

### **Business Challenges**

1. **Profit & Loss:** Identifying the most and least profitable subcategories and products to inform discontinuation or prioritization decisions.
2. **Advertising Efficiency:** Determining optimal locations and months for return on ad spend (ROAS) to maximize profitability.
3. **Return Rate Optimization:** Analyzing return trends to mitigate revenue loss from high-return products and customers.

### **Key Questions**

- Which product subcategories are the biggest profit drivers and loss-makers?
- Which specific products should be removed due to consistent underperformance?
- Where and when should Superstore invest in advertising for the highest return?
- Which products and customers have the highest return rates, and what actions should be taken?

# **Approach**

To answer the key questions and identify actionable insights, we approached with following **visuals in mind:**

- **Average Profit per Unit Sold by Subcategory –** A bar chart to highlight the most and least profitable product subcategories, helping identify where to focus sales efforts and which products may need to be reconsidered.
- **Top & Bottom 10 Products by Profitability –** A bar chart listing the highest and lowest-performing products to pinpoint specific items driving losses.
- **Profitability by State –** A bar chart ranking states by average profit per unit sold to determine which regions contribute most to profitability and which may require strategic adjustments.
- **Advertising Budget vs. Profitability –** A comparative bar chart to evaluate the effectiveness of advertising spend across different states and months, helping optimize future ad investments.
- **Profitability by Month –** A bubble chart to identify seasonal trends, allowing for strategic planning of promotions and inventory adjustments.
- **Return Rate by Customer –** A bar chart displaying customers with the highest return rates, helping detect potential fraud or dissatisfaction.
- **Return Rate by Product –** A bar chart showing the products with the highest return rates, identifying items that may require quality improvements, better descriptions, or pricing adjustments.
- **Profitability vs. Return Rate by Subcategory –** A scatter plot comparing profit margins with return rates to assess whether certain product categories experience high return rates that erode profitability.

# **Key Insights**

- Tables, Bookcases, and Machines consistently underperform, signaling the need for discontinuation or pricing adjustments.
- High-end 3D printers and communication devices (e.g., Cubify CubeX 3D Printer Triple Head and Cisco TelePresence System EX90) generate significant losses.
- Indiana (October), Minnesota (October), and Vermont (November) present the highest profit per unit sold, making them prime locations and months for ad investment.
- A 20% reinvestment of profits into advertising in these states could yield strong returns.
